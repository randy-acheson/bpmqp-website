					<p>According to reports from the National Institutes of Health, obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and as such, weight loss therapies are a serious area of research. One of the most promising advances in weight loss techniques is behavior therapy. In addition to adjustments in food intake and physical activity, strategies including self-monitoring, stress management, and stimulus control are important parts of losing weight. Unlike dietary restrictions and exercise regimens, however, one's behavior is a constantly changing environment that must be watched in order to keep regular.</p>
					<p>A key part of the solution could be technology. Constantly being aware of your eating habits and stress levels is hard to do, and poor understanding of oneself can lead to overeating. Instead, that awareness could be managed by a patient's smart phone instead. A phone is capable of recording health status in real time and providing individualized advice for managing eating habits.</p>
					<p>This project will develop an Android smart phone application called SlipBuddy that records a patient's overeating episodes, along with other factors such as stress level and location, to create a personalized report of the patient's behavior in order to intervene in any future overeating.</p>

					<p>Developing Sugar involves technical challenges captured in two major research objectives. First, this research will <strong>Create Wound Image Analysis Algorithms</strong>, which will analyze the progress (healing and detection) of diabetic foot ulcers from images taken by patients using the phone camera. They will automatically determine wound size and color, from which healing progress can be quantified. The algorithms will compare a wound image to previous images, recognize a new wound, use phone camera flash images that provide only moderate lighting and setting control, and run on a smart phone. Second, it will <strong>Investigate Mechanisms for Changing Patient Behaviors</strong>. This behavioral health objective requires the smart phone to provide timely, patient-tailored reminders and meaningful and actionable feedback about wound and diabetic health progress generated from measures captured or computed by the application.</p>

					<p>Management of chronic illnesses, such as Type 2 diabetics, is challenging for both patients and the health care system. Due to poor circulation, often develop chronic wounds that are slow to heal and that require daily care. Given the cost and inconvenience of regular visits to wound clinics, we are developing image analysis tools that can complement to services rendered by wound clinics. Specifically, we ware developing a smart phone app (Android), which tracks the wound size and wound healing process based on images captured with a smart phone. But weight management, exercise, diet and glucose monitoring are also important in order for the wound to heal properly, and thus the smart phone app is set up stop also acquire such data and to provide constructive feedback.</p>
